# CurriculumLevel
Given data on student enrollment in courses, produces graphs for each subject showing avg seniority by course level

To use the script, you'll need a comma-separated-value (CSV) file with the following fields
Subject: subject code for courses, like BIO, CHE, ENG.
Number: the course number. The script assumes these are three digits, so adjust accordingly
YearTaken: the year of college that a given student has taken this course, e.g. 1,2,3,4

This file should contain per-student/course data for at least a year, but typically two or three years.

To clarify, suppose student 1234 takes four courses the first year. It might generate the following data:

    Subject,Number,YearTaken
    ENG,101,1
    SEM,100,1
    FRE,210,1
    MTH,150,1

The rest of the data is generated by all the other students in the period being considered.

A sample file (grades.csv) is included with dummy data.

Required libraries can be installed with

    install.packages(c("dplyr","tidry","ggplot2"))
